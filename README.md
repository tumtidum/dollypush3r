DollyPush3r is a LEGO MINDSTORMS EV3 robot which pushes a (small) camera dolly for making travel shots. This robot isn't designed for speed, but rather for making slow movements. DollyPush3r was designed with the PC Pico Dolly Kit in mind, but with some modifications it should probably work with many other (small) camera dollies as well.

Key Features:
* Built with the LEGO MINDSTORMS EV3 Home set.
* 4 Modes; ManualStop, AutoStop, StopMotion and TimeLapse.
* Adjustable settings for speed/power, travel distance, time-intervals and total running time.
* Controlled with the EV3 Infrared Beacon/Remote Controller.
* The EV3 Intelligent Brick can easily be (de)attached.

The current version (v0.1) is an Alpha release, but it seems to function quite fine already. Maybe DollyPush3r could be useful for anyone out there as well.
